The Crestal referral program enables users to unlock referral codes by completing quests on the Crestal dApp. These codes can be shared with friends to earn **Rock Boosters**, which increase rewards for both referrers and referred friends.

## How It Works

### 1. Earn Referral Codes
- Complete quests on the Crestal dApp to unlock referral codes.
- If you have used Crestal Carbon before, you will receive 5 referral codes visible under your profile.

### 2. Share Referral Codes
- Share your referral codes with friends.
- Friends can claim and use the code to join the platform and start completing quests.

### 3. Earn Rock Boosters
- As your friends complete quests using your referral code, both you and your friends earn **Rock Boosters** based on quest completion and streaks.

## Referral Benefits

- **Up to 3x Rock Boost**: During the first 4 weeks, both referrers and referred friends can earn up to a 3x Rock Boost.
- **Tier-Based Scaling**: Increase your referrer tier by inviting more friends:
  - **Tier 1**: 1-3 friends = 10% Rock Booster.
  - **Tier 2**: 4-10 friends = 15% Rock Booster.
  - **Tier 3**: 11+ friends = 20% Rock Booster.
- **Quest Streak Rewards**: Earn a 5% Rock Boost each time your friends complete a 3-week quest streak. This booster stacks with every additional streak.

- **Tier 1**: 1–3 friends referred = 10% Rock Booster.
- **Tier 2**: 4–10 friends referred = 15% Rock Booster.
- **Tier 3**: 11+ friends referred = 20% Rock Booster.

## Tracking Your Referrals
